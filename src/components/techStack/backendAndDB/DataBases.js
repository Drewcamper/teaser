      <h1>Exploring SQL and MongoDB</h1>
      <h3>SQL</h3>
      <div>
        Relational databases, represented by the Structured Query Language (SQL), have been the
        backbone of data management for decades.Here's what you can expect from my SQL expertise:
      </div>
      <div>
        designing robust relational databases, crafting well-defined schemas that ensure data
        integrity and consistency. designing normalized tables or creating complex relationships
      </div>
      <div>
        efficient SQL querie. optimizing queries to retrieve, update, or manipulate data swiftly,
        ensuring optimal performance even in high-traffic applications.
      </div>
      <div>
        I understand the importance of scaling SQL databases as applications grow. From indexing
        strategies to partitioning techniques, I can ensure databases can handle increasing
        workloads.
      </div>
      <h3>MongoDB</h3>
      <div>
        In the era of unstructured and semi-structured data, MongoDB emerges as a powerhouse for
        flexibility and scalability. Here's how I leverage MongoDB:
      </div>
      <div>document based modelling</div>
      <div>MongoDB's document-oriented approach is a perfect fit for dynamic data.</div>
      <div>Aggregation: </div>
      <div>Horizontal Scalability</div>
      <div>
        With MongoDB's built-in sharding capabilities, I can architect solutions that scale
        horizontally, distributing data across clusters to handle extensive workloads seamlessly.
      </div>
      <div>
        Starting in MongoDB 5.1 with built-in sharding capabilities, I can architect solutions that
        scale horizontally, distributing data across clusters to handle extensive workloads
        seamlessly.
      </div>
