      <h1>Choosing the Right Tool for the Job</h1>
      <div>
        In the dynamic world of web development, having a toolbox that includes both npm and Yarn
        allows me to make informed decisions based on project requirements. While npm serves as my
        go-to choice for its extensive ecosystem and community support, Yarn steps in when I need
        precise control over installations and want to ensure predictability and efficiency.

      <h1>Npm</h1>
      <h3>Extensive Repository</h3>
      <h3>Robust Version Control</h3>
      <h3>Community-Driven</h3>
      <h3>Seamless Integration</h3>
      <h1>Yarn</h1>
      <div>
        While I primarily use npm, I also recognize the strengths of Yarn and appreciate its utility
        in certain scenarios
      </div>
      <h3>Predictable Installs</h3>
      <div>
        Yarn was designed with predictability in mind. It locks down dependencies to ensure
        consistent installations across different environments, which can be particularly useful for
        teams and deployment pipelines.
      </div>
      <h3>Parallel Installation</h3>
      <div>
        Yarn's parallel package installation can significantly speed up the installation process,
        making it an appealing choice for projects with extensive dependencies.
      </div>
      <h3>Offline Mode</h3>
      <div>
        Yarn offers an offline mode, which can be advantageous in situations with limited internet
        access or for building Docker images where internet connectivity is restricted.
